At the age of 4, she moved with her family (father Carlo Esposito, mother Iris Barzaghi, and sister Adriana Esposito) to Padova. After graduating from High School (classics, with Greek and Latin) she studied Chinese language and philosophy at the University of Venice (Ca'Foscari), Fudan University in Shanghai, and the University of Gent in Belgium. After graduation with a thesis on Qigong in 1987, she continued her studies under the direction of Prof. Isabelle Robinet at the Department of Far Eastern Studies of the University of Paris. After obtaining the Diploma of Advanced Studies (D.E.A.) on texts of the Daoist canon in 1988, she returned to Shanghai and studied at the Academy of Social Science of Shanghai under the direction of Prof. Chen Yaoting. Her graduate studies ended in 1993 with a summa cum laude Ph.D. in Far Eastern Studies; thesis The Dragon Gate - The Longmen school of Mount Jin'gai and its alchemical practices according to the Daozang xubian (complement to the Daoist canon). During several stays in China and Tibet, Dr. Esposito conducted extensive field work on Qigong, Taiji, Daoist and Buddhist (particularly Zogchen) practices in China. After post-doctoral studies at the Department of Indological and Far-Eastern Studies of the University of Venice (1994-1995), at the Sorbonne in Paris (1995-1997), and at Kansai University in Osaka, she established permanent residence in Kyoto in 1998 and married Urs App. Between 1998 and 2003 she concentrated on field studies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and continental China leading to the production, together with her husband, of several highly acclaimed video productions about Far Eastern religions. After being elected Associate Professor at Kyoto University's Institute for Research in Humanistic Studies (Jinbun Kagaku kenkûjo) in 2003, Dr. Esposito continued her research on Daoist texts of the Ming and Qing periods. She conceived and directed the Daozang Jiyao research project (), an international research project with over sixty scientific collaborators on the most important Daoist text collection of the Qing period. For portions of this large project, which began in 2006, Dr. Esposito obtained important grants from the Chiang Ching-kuo foundation (2006-2009 and 2010-2013) and from the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS; 2008-2011).

He debuted with prose translation of Shakespeare in 1858 and quickly established himself as one of the leading contributors to the principal Georgian literary magazine Tsiskari. His works -- full of satirical touches -- are noted for their realistic portrayal of social life in old Tbilisi. His best known novella Solomon Isakich Mejganuashvili (სოლომონ ისაკიჩ მეჯღანუაშვილი, 1861) is a first-person life-story told by the eponymous hero of the Tiflis Armenian milieu, who starts modestly as a small tradesman and then turn to money lending so that the aristocracy also falls into his clutches. He now aims at becoming accepted in beau monde and wants to marry his daughter off to a Georgian prince Alexander Raindidze who, a well-bred and enlightened liberal man, is presented as a contrast to the character of Solomon.

Her father Volodymir Poryvai and her mother Ludmila Poryvai (maiden name Bystrik) were conductors of the Kiev Teachers Choir Cappella ``Svitoch''. From an early age, Russya had an intense interest in music, especially Ukrainian folk music and European classical music.She started her first pianolessons at age 5 and continued studying through graduation from high school. Later, she was enrolled at Kiev Music College, named after composer Glier, where she studied piano and choirconducting. Shortly before graduating from College she met and latter married Konstantin Ossaoulenko, musician and songwriter. Together they formed a team and became one of the most successful performer-songwriter teams in Ukrainian pop music of late 80's and early 90's. Russya's first album ``The Fortuneteller'' 1989, was a major success. The album contained 3 Top 10 Ukrainian hits, #1 ``Don't Stand By My Window', ''The Mermaid``, and the title track itself, ''The Fortuneteller. The follow-up album, ``The Enchanted Circle'' in 1989, brought her wide recognition in Ukraine and another #1 title song. The following year 1990, she released the album, ``Forgive Me Mommy''. This album won her the title, Best Female Artist of Ukraine. The album spawned another #1 ``Forgive me Mommy'' and three more Ukrainian Top 10 songs, ``Whatever Will Be, Will Be'', ``Let Them Talk'', and ``Little Swan''. In the summer and fall of 1990 Russya continued touring in support of the album, ``Forgive Me Mommy''. The fourth album, ``Cinderella'', was released in May 1991 . The song ``Blondie Girl'' went straight to #1 for the entire summer of 1991. The album also produced two more Ukrainian top 10 songs, ``Cinderella'' and ``Don't Forget''. For the second time, back to back in 1991, she won The Best Female Artist of Ukraine award. In late 1991, Russya traveled to Canada to record an album for the Yevshan Ukrainian record label in Montreal. It was her first release of an album in Canada and the United States. The album was entitled just simply ``Russya''. She remained in Canada to support the album release and performed at concerts in Ukrainian clubs and Churches throughout Canada and the United States. In 1993 after the untimely death of her father, she returned to the studio to record an album of classical Ukrainian pop songs, ``Cheremshyna'', dedicated to the memory of her parent. The album was released in 1994. It did not receive the high acclaim of her previous albums mainly due to the difference in style and genre. The same year she went back into the studio and recorded the album, ``Kiyv Girl''. The title song made its way into the Ukrainian top 10 in 1994. The next album, ``My American Guy'' was released in 1997. Russya retired from recording pop music in 1997 but continued to tour, sometimes with her sister Natasha Koroleva til 1999. In 2007 she returned to the recording studio and released her CD entitled, ``The Best Of Russya''. In 2009 she recorded new album ``Small Presents'' It is her first release since 1997 in presenting new songs in more than 12 years.\",\n",

Her first competition event was in the 2006 German national race, where she disqualified in the Slalom and did not finish the Giant Slalom. She has competed since then in a variety of alpine skiing events, including the slalom, giant slalom, downhill, and super combined, at a number of junior international competitions, although she is listed by the International Ski Federation as having not finished more than half of the races she has entered. As of February, 2010, her best finish in any competition was 2nd, at a giant slalom event in Germany. Oettl Reyes was selected at the age of 18 to be one of three members of Peru's delegation to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, the first Peruvian team to participate in the Winter Olympics. Her younger brother Manfred Oettl Reyes, also an alpine skier, was selected for the team as well. She is scheduled to compete in both the slalom and giant slalom competitions there, although she was not expected to be in serious competition for a medal. Her participation on behalf of Peru was questioned by some, as she was not only born in Germany but lives there and is of Peruvian descent on only one side of her family. She and her brother were last minute additions to the Olympic roster. They both met the minimum time qualifications for participation, but that participation was questioned as neither had taken part in a World Championship prior to the Olympics. In response to this criticism, the Peruvian Olympic Committee explained that they were in the process of receiving their Peruvian passports when the last World Championships took place, and so could not yet compete on behalf of Peru. The controversy also prompted some commenters to question why the Peruvian government has not done more to identify and develop athletes within the country. However, the practice of smaller countries sending athletes who are technically citizens of those countries but who reside elsewhere to participate in international competitions is not uncommon. Despite the controversy, the pair asked Peruvians to embrace them and their participation on behalf of Peru at the Olympics.\",\n",

The original facade design by Giotto was found outdated for the cathedral and so a series of three competitions were held to modify Giotto's original design, keeping with the main lines of the structure. The challenge for the competition was to create a facade which brought together two periods in architecture: the Gothic style, which had faded out, and the Renaissance style, which was more recent. In 1871, Fabris' design won, and he immediately went to work embellishing the cathedral with red, green, and white marble.

Dixon has created cover art for Scientific American, Sky and Telescope, Omni, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, Astronomy Magazine, and many other publications. Dixon's paintings have been used to illustrate the covers of several science fiction books, such as the Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson and the Galactic Center Saga by Gregory Benford.

During his time with the agency he travelled the globe, bearing first hand witness to events of historical importance. Covering natural catastrophes, civil and ethnic wars, and urban riots, he came face to face with the complexity of the human condition and the random events by which it is fashioned. His thirst for freedom and an imperious need for self-expression rapidly convinced him to go freelance. Reserving himself the right to focus on the world's most important issues, he delivers startling images filtered through an ever-evolving aesthetic prism. Constantly breaking down barriers, he is, by turn, a photographer working on communication campaigns, and an investigator deconstructing the great sagas of contemporary life for the international portrait press for which his photographs of athletes, artists, ecclesiastics and politicians have become iconic. His images have earned him a number of prizes, including four prestigious World Press Awards. Following his domain of predilection, in a ``journey to the heart of man'' he becomes the wakeful observer of his contemporaries. This marginal perspective involves real mises en scène, veritable simulacra of the world in which we live. Internationally renowned, Gérard Rancinan's work is exhibited in the world's most prestigious galleries and museums and features in the most important contemporary art collections. During a recent Etude Million auction at Drouot (2008), Gérard Rancinan became one of the highest ranked photographers in France. Gérard Rancinan is a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres.\",\n",

Later, he continued his studies in Germany, and has concentrated on aircraft engine construction. Following that, he has worked as a constructor in the factory Laurin & Klement. Together with his colleague, engineer Hieronymus, Kašpar participated on construction of the first aircraft engine in the Czech lands. His passion for aviation forced him to leave the company and devote solely to aircraft construction, together with his cousin Evžen Čihák. His first attempts to construct a monoplane were inspired by the model Antoinette by the French designer Hubert Latham. In 1909, during the construction of own monoplane, Kašpar heard about Blériot's successful flight from Calais to Dover. Kašpar has finished his own aircraft, however, he was unable to take off. Some of his first attempts nearly cost him his life. Therefore, he decided to buy the model Blériot XI (No. 76) by the French manufacturer.

Michael Scott led petitions to the United Nations which eventually led to the recognition of Namibia's status as a sovereign country under colonial control by South Africa. He was also the Leader of Hereroland from 1968-1970. In 1920, Hosea Kutako was officially appointed as leader of the Herero by Frederik Maharero. Frederik had been empowered to transfer power by his father, Herero chief Samuel Maharero, who had been exiled after the Herero War and was since banned from entering the country by the South African Mandatory Administration. Hosea Kutako took over his role as a commitment to preserve the memory of the glorious times of the Herero before and during the German colonisation as well as of the atrocities in the battle of Waterberg. Already in 1920, he founded the Green Flags, an association to keep up tradition, and went on by founding the Red Flags in 1923, after Samuel Maharero's death. Kutako prompted and organised the transfer of Samuel Maharero's body and its funeral on Okahandja next to the grave of Jonker Afrikaner. Kutako also founded the Truppenspieler association. It was meant to get military importance which was opposed both by the South African authorities and by Sam Nujoma, the co-founder of the South West African People's Organisation SWAPO. So, the Truppenspieler had to content themselves with an accompanying role at Herero Day. Along with Nujoma, Hosea Kutako founded the South West African National Union (SWANU) in 1959, an organisation that was to merge into SWAPO a year later. It later re-emerged as a separate political entity. Despite his age, Hosea Kutako particularly engaged for the independence of future Namibia. Windhoek's international airport, the country's primary international airport, is named after him. In July 2010, Kutako's former home in the Omaheke Region was nominated by the Omaheke Regional Council to become a national heritage site.\",\n",

Widely traveled, he was a member of the armed forces, orator, composer, writer, and congressman. Having joined the army at the age of 16, he combatted under the command of his father against insurgent forces. Nonetheless, he was forced to flee Bolivia and lived abroad since 1847, when his father was toppled from power and exiled, first to Chile and then to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. While traveling in Valparaíso, Chile, he met and married Carmen Grimwood Allende, of Quillota, Chile. Following his father's unexpected death in Brazil in 1855, Ballivián Coll returned to his native land. At first he attempted to rejoin the army and rose to the rank of Liutenant Colonel. Discouraged from continuing a military career (many mistrusted him for his obvious charisma, education, and potential to become a rival in an era of military supremacy in politics), he was persuaded to run for Congress instead. There he first shone as a brilliant orator and gifted defender of constitutionalism and the rule of law. He also became a part-time journalist.\",\n",

He studied theology at Geneva and at Strasbourg, and at an early age succeeded his uncle, C. A. Coquerel, as editor of Le Lien, a post which he held till 1870. In 1852 he took part in establishing the Nouvelle Revue de théologie, the first periodical of scientific theology published in France, and in the same year helped to found the Historical Society of French Protestantism. Meanwhile he had gained a high reputation as a preacher, and especially as the advocate of religious freedom; but his teaching became more and more offensive to the orthodox party, and on the appearance (1864) of his article on Renan's Vie de Jésus in the Nouvelle Revue de théologie he was forbidden by the Paris consistory to continue his ministerial functions. He received an address of sympathy from the consistory of Anduze, and a provision was voted for him by the Union Protestante Libérale, to enable him to continue his preaching. He received the cross of the Légion d'honneur in 1862. His chief works were Jean Calas et sa famille (1858); Des Beaux-Arts en Italie (Eng. trans. 1859); La Saint-Barthélémy (1860); Précis de l'Eglise réformée (1862); Le Catholicisme et le protestantisme considérés dans leur origine et leur développement (1864); Libres études, and La Conscience et la foi (1867).\",\n",

For the next decade he lived abroad, first in Spain and then in France. In Paris he became acquainted with numerous Cuban intellectuals; among them was Alejo Carpentier, who encouraged him to develop his talent to depict native Cuban themes. Encounters with the work of Jules Pascin and Marc Chagall further shaped his style. Upon his return to Cuba, Abela created the character of ``El Bobo'' (``The Fool'') as a protest against the Machado government. This he drew for El Diario de la Marina from 1930 until 1934. Abela's criollo character played the fool to satirize the difficult social and political situation in Cuba under Machado. In the second half of the 1930s Abela returned to painting, employing a naturalistic style influenced by early Renaissance painting and the Mexican mural movement. At this time he focused on an idealized view of the Cuban peasant and the countryside, as seen in his most renowned painting, Los Guajiros (1938), in which the Classical sobriety and order is the result of his contact with Italian medieval and Renaissance art. He also continued to paint, serving later in his career as a cultural attaché to Mexico and Guatemala, and in 1937 operating the short-lived Free Studio of Painting and Sculpture. Abela died in 1965.\",\n",
